# Grammar Cloze Adventure

Grammar Cloze Adventure is an interactive browser-based game for practicing grammar skills. It presents passages with missing words and allows players to drag or tap words into the blanks. Hints, a timer and challenge modes are included, along with optional audio cues and dyslexia-friendly fonts.

## Running

Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required. Simply double-click the file or open it via `File > Open` in your browser.

## Optional Dependencies

The project can make use of additional assets when present:

- **Fonts**: `styles.css` references the `OpenDyslexic` font files located under `fonts/`. If these fonts are missing, the page will fall back to standard fonts.
- **Sound files**: `index.html` expects `correct.mp3` and `incorrect.mp3` for sound effects. If these files are absent, the game will run without audio feedback.
